api call in js
---------------

AJAX 

-Xmlhttps
-fetch
-asynch(f) await(c)

redirection in react
---------------------
react-router-dom 
-npm i  react-router-dom 
import 
{BrowserRouter  as Router       -  all routing need components
,Routes                         - to set paths for each components
,Route                          -more than one path
} from 'react-router-dom'
as used to shorten the module name

useparams - hook used to accesss params from component url

REDUX 
---------

coupling  -many connection bw parent and child component

= props drillinng- in couplingif any intermediate have any errors all othr childs will not work
 
to avoid props drilling we need to reduce  copling and make all the components independent 

for this react introduced a new technology -  state management technology - REDUX


redux process
-------------

create a new js file to keep the states , all the components can access the js  file 

-components can access the datas from the js file but  they cant update datas in js file

-Action =>  a file where all the logics to update the state 
-Dispatch =>method used to dispatch the logic in action file when the component need state updation
Reducer => update the datas in js file according to the payload responce get action file

libraries to aply redux
------------------------

1.REDUX
2.REACT-REDUX
3.REDUX-THUNK

npm i redux react-redux redux-thunk
createStore() - method in REDUX  used to create store in js file
              - 2 args
              -1- Reducer
              -2- middleware  ( used to make synchrounous redux into asynchrounous )
redux is actually synchrounous

applyMiddleware() - method in REDUX to apply middleware

combineReducers() - method in REDUX used to combine all the reducers in js file 

thunk - in REDUX-THUNK ,used to create middleware 

spread opeator - used to convert object to array

1. create store 
2. apply the store in index.js  
    -provider - its a tag used to  pass the store (react-redux)
